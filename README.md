# Digital Clinic Book

## Overview

The **Digital Clinic Book** is a conceptual software project that explores replacing traditional paper-based clinic books in **Papua New Guinea** with a secure digital alternative.

The project demonstrates how patient medical records could be digitally stored, accessed, and shared across healthcare facilities to improve continuity of care, while remaining realistic about ethical, professional, and regulatory constraints.

This repository represents a **demonstration and proof of concept**, not a production-ready system.

## Background and Motivation

In many healthcare settings in Papua New Guinea, patient medical history is recorded using physical clinic books. This approach introduces several challenges:

- Records can be lost, damaged, or incomplete  
- Patients must physically carry their medical history  
- Medical professionals lack access to prior treatment data from other facilities  
- Continuity of care is fragmented across hospitals and clinics  

This project explores how a digital system could address these challenges without overreaching into clinical decision-making or automated diagnosis.

## What Is a Digital Clinic Book?

A **Digital Clinic Book** is a digital representation of a patient’s medical history that:

- Stores treatment records securely online  
- Allows access only to **vetted and registered medical professionals**  
- Enables continuity of care across multiple healthcare facilities  

Patients retain ownership of their medical records, while access is governed by authentication and authorization mechanisms rather than physical documents.

## What the System Provides

At a conceptual level, the system demonstrates:

- Centralized storage of medical records  
- Role-based access control for medical professionals  
- Cross-facility visibility of prior treatments  
- Auditability of record access and usage  

The focus is on **information availability and access**, not automation of medical judgment.

---

## Project Scope

This repository serves as a **demonstration project**.

It does **not** implement:

- Real patient data  
- Live hospital or clinic integration  
- Clinical decision support systems  
- Diagnosis or treatment recommendations  

The emphasis is on **system structure, data flow, and access control**, rather than clinical logic.

## Why This Project Matters

This project highlights the intersection of:

- Software engineering  
- Public health infrastructure  
- Ethical system design  
- Region-specific constraints  

It is intended to support discussion and exploration around digital health systems rather than claim readiness for real-world deployment.
